========================================================================================================================================

( Junior ) Front-End Developer.
-------------------------------

\- I am a novice Front-End Developer, no experience as I am still learning. - Why did I choose Front-End Developer? I like that here I almost immediately see the result of my work, in comparison with the Back-End Developer. I think it's very exciting and promising, because you can do the whole user interface with the Fron-End instruments. And applications and sites like mine will always be needed, everywhere. - I try not just to learn (memorize), but I want to understand what is working and how it is working. That is why I read a lot of books, articles and do practice (unfortunately I do not have much time to practice). - I do like clean and minimal code. I try to write it as well and to give a lot of comments to the code. - I like to learn something new, to research, to figure everything out, it allows to develop my skills. And probably it would be wrong not to mention that money and possibility to work remotely also became one of the factors of choosing this profession. - Actually now I am studying at Tel Run school, here we study HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, Git, GitHub, and a few Linux commands. I'm also looking through a lot of other tutorial videos. - I am open to new suggestions, or even just to new acquaintances.
